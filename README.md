## Setup Instructions

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the comprehensive guide on Qiita:

ðŸ“– **[VIVE MR Unity Template Setup Guide](https://qiita.com/afjk/items/f723f6dd2101f9b85905)**

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or Use This Template**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afjk/VIVE-MR-Unity-Template.git
   cd VIVE-MR-Unity-Template
   ```

2. **Open in Unity**
   - Open Unity Hub
   - Add the project folder
   - Open with Unity 2023.3 (6000.0.48f1) or compatible version

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Switch platform to Android
   - Configure XR settings for your target device
   - Build and deploy to your VIVE device

## GitHub Actions Automated Builds

This template includes GitHub Actions workflow for automated Android builds. The workflow:

- Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch
- Can be manually triggered from the Actions tab
- Builds APK/AAB files for Android deployment
- Uploads build artifacts for download

### Setting Up Automated Builds

If you want to use the automated build feature:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Set up the following GitHub Secrets** in your repository settings:
   - `UNITY_LICENSE`: Your Unity license file content (.ulf)
   - `UNITY_EMAIL`: Your Unity account email
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD`: Your Unity account password

### Unity License File (.ulf) Requirements

To run Unity builds on GitHub Actions, you need a Unity license file (.ulf), even for Personal licenses. 

**Finding your Unity license file:**

- **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf`
- **Mac**: `/Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`

For detailed instructions on obtaining and using Unity license files in CI/CD, refer to the official GameCI documentation:
